Version 4: this version simply extends the 3rd one such as to play with more than three columns and rows.


One module for several ¨guis: inside the folder path::``several-guis-one-data-model``, we will use a module for the data model (see `natural_model.py`). For the moment we have just one ¨tkinter GUI.


More strict use of `global` : no more names forgotten with `global ...`.


Bug: the function `nextplayer` was indeed good implemented at the first time in the versions 2 and 3. The not-a-bug problem came from a confusion between `CROSS, EMPTY, DISK = range(-1, 2)` and `PLAYERS = [CROSS, DISK]`.

Horror version : for pedagogical reason, one version without any iterable or function has been build using a little of black magic.


Bug: the function `nextplayer` was bad implemented in the versions 2 and 3.

Version 2: this version uses a new data model that eases the testing in ``game_state``.


Version 3: this version uses ``tkinter`` for the GUI.


Bug: wrong implementation of the detection of equality in the function ``game_state`` (this was not tested before the GUI version !).

Version 1: the "play alone" mode should be fully functional and it has been implemented in a single ¨python file.
