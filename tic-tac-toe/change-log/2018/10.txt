Version 5: two changes.

    1) A function ``coord_2_pos`` has been added to convert cartesian like coordinates to the corresponding position in ``GRID_INLINE``.

    2) The making of ``PATTERN_TO_TEST`` uses now a "linear" logic instead of a "grid" one.


Version 6: this version merely uses only binary operations for the datas.

General changes: simplification of the function ``game_state`` in all the versions.


Bug: in path::``tictactoe-v5-regex.py``, the functions were only implemented for a grid of size `3`.

==========

Version 4: this version simply extends the 3rd one such as to play with more than three columns and rows.


Version 5: this version uses strings and regexes.


General changes:

    1) One module for several ¨guis: inside the folder path::``several-guis-one-data-model``, we will use a module for the data model (see `datamodel.py`). For the moment we have just one ¨tkinter GUI.

    2) Limitation of the size of the grid: the minimum value is 3 and the maximum one is 20....

    3) More strict use of `global`: no more names forgotten with ``global ...``.


Bug: the function ``nextplayer`` was indeed good implemented at the first time in the versions 2 and 3. The not-a-bug problem came from a confusion between ``CROSS, EMPTY, DISK = range(-1, 2)`` and ``PLAYERS = [CROSS, DISK]``.

==========

Horror version: for pedagogical reason, one version without any iterable or function has been build using a little of black magic.


Bug: the function ``nextplayer`` was bad implemented in the versions 2 and 3.


==========
2018-10-05
==========

Version 2: this version uses a new data model that eases the testing in ``game_state``.


Version 3: this version uses ¨tkinter for the GUI.


Bug: wrong implementation of the detection of equality in the function ``game_state`` (this was not tested before the GUI version !).


==========
2018-10-04
==========

Version 1: the "play alone" mode should be fully functional and it has been implemented in a single ¨python file.
